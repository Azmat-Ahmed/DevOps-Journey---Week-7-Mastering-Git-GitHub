# DevOps-Journey---Week-7-Mastering-Git-GitHub
In Week 7 of my DevOps learning journey, I focused deeply on **Git** and **GitHub**, covering every foundational and advanced concept necessary to manage code effectively in a team environment.

## 🔧 Key Concepts Covered

- Initializing repositories with `git init`
- Adding files to staging with `git add`
- Creating snapshots with `git commit`
- Switching branches using `git checkout`
- Creating and managing branches with `git branch`
- Renaming branches (`git branch -m`)
- Merging branches (`git merge`)
- Using `git pull` and `git push` for remote collaboration
- Handling merge conflicts
- Understanding `git cherry-pick`, `git log`, `git status`, `git diff`, etc.

## 🔀 Branching Strategy

I implemented and practiced:
- Creating multiple branches like `main`, `feature1`, etc.
- Making separate changes in each branch
- Merging features back into `main`
- Experimenting with cherry-pick to copy specific commits
